## App Design

Standard web server w/ db, when songs are requested search the db to see if they already exist. If they donâ€™t exist, fire off a request to the async server which can go out and locate the song, then hit a webhook on the web server with the result.

Use SSE to push data to clients to keep them up to date. SSE loop can check memcached to see if current state has changed, and if so update it.
